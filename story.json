            "The last noise the engine on Lanas boat made was a kind of high pitched chirp. You tried to get it working but with no effect. As the sun got lower and the fog grew thicker your optimism faded. You don't have any grasp on how long you have been drifting. The fog is so dense that you can't see the sun. Or the moon? How long has it been? It feels like you've been drifting for days.",
            "The little food and water you brought didn't last long. The hunger isn't so bad yet, but the thirst is... worse. At least you are not alone. Having Lana with you is a small comfort, but your conversations grew more and more dismal as the severity of the situation dawned on the two of you. You had been quietly staring into the grey mist for some time when Lana breaks the silence.",
